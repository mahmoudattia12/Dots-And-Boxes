# Dots-And-Boxes
Our application is a game called dots and boxes. Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box (or groups of one or more adjacent boxes) earns one point (s) and takes another turn. The player with the highest score is the winner.
